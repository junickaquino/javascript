==================

Asynchronous - When something is going on but you dont want to wait until its done to continue your program. You want to continue while it's happening.
Synchronous - Something is happening, but you have to wait before you ove on to the next.

Problem:
    Does not display Post Three
    because the setTimeout for CreatePost takes longer than the getPosts function.
    By the time CreatePost was executed, the system already displayed the available posts.


Solution 1 - Added callback parameters.
Solution 2 - Using a promise
Solution 3 - Using promise all + fetch
Solution 4 - Using async await
Solution 5 - Using async await with Fetch
